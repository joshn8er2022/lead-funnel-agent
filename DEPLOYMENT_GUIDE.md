git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

## Step 4: Configure Typeform Webhooks

For **Hume Connect** form (F7whHyXK):

1. Open form in Typeform
2. Go to **Connect** â†’ **Webhooks**
3. Add webhook URL:
   ```
   https://api.github.com/repos/YOUR_USERNAME/lead-funnel-agent/dispatches
   ```
4. In "Secret" add your GitHub Personal Access Token:
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Generate new token (classic)
   - Select scopes: `repo`, `workflow`
   - Copy token
5. In webhook headers, add:
   ```
   Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json
   Authorization: Bearer YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
   ```
6. In the body, select "Send raw JSON" and use:
   ```json
   {
     "event_type": "typeform_submission",
     "client_payload": {
       "form_id": "F7whHyXK",
       "response_id": "{{hidden:response_id}}",
       "submitted_at": "{{submitted_at}}",
       "answers": {{answers}}
     }
   }
   ```
7. Test the webhook

Repeat for **Hume Hardware** form (wR9Ufu8Z).

## Step 5: Test the Agent

### Manual Test Run:

1. Go to your repo â†’ **Actions** tab
2. Click "Lead Funnel Automation Agent"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select `test_integrations`
5. Click "Run workflow"
6. Watch the logs - all tests should pass

### Test with Real Submission:

1. Submit a test form in Typeform
2. Check GitHub Actions - should trigger automatically
3. Check #ai-test Slack channel for notification
4. Check Close CRM for new lead

## Step 6: Monitor

The agent will now run automatically:
- **9am PT** (4pm UTC) - Morning run
- **5pm PT** (12am UTC) - Evening run

You can:
- View logs in **GitHub Actions**
- Get notifications in **#ai-test Slack**
- See all leads in **Close CRM**

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Actions not running

Check:
- Actions are enabled: `Settings â†’ Actions â†’ General â†’ Allow all actions`
- Secrets are set correctly (no spaces, correct names)

### Slack not posting

Check:
- Bot is invited to #ai-test
- Token starts with `xoxb-`
- Scopes are correct

### Emails not sending

Check:
- SendGrid domain authentication: `sendgrid.com â†’ Settings â†’ Sender Authentication`
- From email matches authenticated domain
- API key has "Full Access" permissions

### Close CRM errors

Check:
- API key is valid
- You have permission to create leads
- Status IDs match your org (see `close_sync.py` line 148)

## Need Help?

Message in #ai-test:
```
